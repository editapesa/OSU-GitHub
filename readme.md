# Portfolio

A portfolio is necessary for any future web developer to present to potential employers. It should showcase skills, talents, and highlight their strongest work.

Some core skills applied in creating this portfolio were flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. 

This portfolio does not contain deployed web applications (only placeholder images and names), but will in the future as projects get completed.

The portfolio can be viewed here. [portfolio] (https://editapesa.github.io/homework-2/)
